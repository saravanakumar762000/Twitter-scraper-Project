                     TWITTER SCRAPPER

Hi , I created a Twitter Scraping project based on the domain of social media.

Here we used Snscrape, Mongodb, Python, Streamlit.

*We used function Python method to scrape the twitter data and upload the data to Mongodb.

*After that we use the streamlit graphical user interface to create a web app to dislay and save the data.

To install Snscrape:

              Pip install sncrape  
           Or(use the developer version)
   pip install git+https://github.com/JustAnotherArchivist/snscrape.git

EXECUTION:

*After installing the snscrape we use the sncrape to import the twitter data and store it in dataframe.

*Once we store it in dataframe and we upload the data in the Mongodb database to store the data as dictionary.

*After finishing this we use streamlit to create a web application for display the data and download the data.

*Once we finished the all process run the projcet by streamlit run (your file name).py
